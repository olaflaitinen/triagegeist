# Code of Conduct

triagegeist follows the [Google Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct) and a code of conduct consistent with an inclusive, professional, and technically focused community.

---

## Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in the triagegeist project and community a harassment-free and welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected behaviour

- **Be respectful**: Treat others with respect and professionalism. Disagreement is acceptable; personal attacks are not.
- **Be constructive**: Focus on technical merit, evidence, and improvement. Offer actionable feedback.
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome new contributors and help them align with project norms and documentation.
- **Be precise**: Use clear language in issues, pull requests, and code. Avoid ambiguous or off-topic discussions in technical channels.

---

## Unacceptable behaviour

The following are considered unacceptable:

- **Harassment**: Offensive comments, trolling, insults, or discriminatory language related to personal characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion, disability).
- **Threats or violence**: Threats of violence, intimidation, or incitement to harm.
- **Doxxing**: Publishing others' private information without consent.
- **Unprofessional conduct**: Sustained disruption, derailing threads, or refusing to follow maintainer decisions after discussion.
- **Retaliation**: Negative action against someone for reporting or participating in an investigation.

---

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to:

- Repository spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
- Official communication channels linked from the project (e.g. mailing list, chat)
- Public events or meetings where the project is represented

It also applies to behaviour outside these spaces when it is clearly linked to the project (e.g. social media posts targeting contributors or the project).

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers (see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this code of conduct. They may:

- **Warn**: A private or public warning with an explanation of the violation.
- **Temporary ban**: Temporary exclusion from the repository or channels (e.g. 30 days).
- **Permanent ban**: Permanent exclusion for serious or repeated violations.

Maintainers will strive to be fair and proportionate and to document decisions where appropriate without violating privacy.

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour:

1. **Contact**: Report to the maintainers (see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)) or, if the report concerns a maintainer, to another maintainer or the repository owner.
2. **Content**: Include what happened, where (e.g. issue number, channel), and who was involved. You may report anonymously if your platform allows it, though named reports help investigation.
3. **Confidentiality**: Reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible while allowing a fair investigation and corrective action.

We will acknowledge your report and follow up with next steps. We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports in good faith.

## Attribution

This code of conduct is adapted from principles used by Google Open Source and similar open source communities. It is not legal advice; it describes community expectations and how we will respond to violations.
